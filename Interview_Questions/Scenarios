Hi Lakshminarayan ,

Follow the following steps to do that ::
----------------------------------------

1. Create a server and install Nginx/Apache and up the service with 8080 port.    ====DONE

2. Create a Freenom account and buy a DNS name for free    --- DONE

	lakshminarayan.tk 

3. Create a S3 bucket with the same as lakshminarayan.tk name as you created above and follow below steps.

	-  turn on Static Website Hosting in Properties and choose the Redirect response option and configure it with the following options

    - Target bucket or domain: my.ip:8080
    - Protocol: Leave this blank     ----- DONE

4. Go to Route53 and create a Record Set with the following configuration

   - Name: lakshminarayan.tk
   - Type: A-IPv4 address
   - Alias: Yes
   - Alias Target: Choose the bucket you just created in S3. If it does not appear wait for it to appear.
   - Routing Policy: Simple
   - Evaluate Target Health: No

5. Copy the NS names and paste in the Freenom site.


Wait for some time for the reflection. For me it's took 3 minutes.

And that's it, In the place of server name try with your LBname/another DNS name .

Best of luck LakshmiNarayan !!!!

Thanks,
Anand Reddy
